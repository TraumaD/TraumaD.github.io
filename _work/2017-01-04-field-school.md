In January of 2017 I built the site for Field Grade School. They really only wanted a few things on it.
* Their mission statement
* Their contact information
* A place for parents and board members to download the school's documents

They were really looking for a no maintance site as they did not have anyone on staff who could maintain it and no funds to hire someone to do so.
As such I tried to provide both fairly future-proof and legacy browser supported code, and a simple unobtrusive design.
