Tech? Code? Design? Coffee? Travel? Video games? Random rants of my mind?
After racking my brain for several days on what to write about in my first blog post, I finally decided that this post should just introduce the blog, and give you some insight to the theme and purpose of the blog itself. The theme is simple: there really isn't one.
I created this blog with two main purposes in mind:

1. One of my personal "self-bettering" projects that I have been wanting to work on is my writing skills, and what improves writing better than...well, writing?
2. Create a place where I can organize my thoughts and go on rants when necessary.

I used to be pretty good at writing in high school, when we had to write papers for assignments, I typically got A's and praise from the teacher grading it. You know, the old "excellent!" Or "Great point of view", something like that. My mom is a literature teacher so that helped. Then, when I got into college I quit writing because I didn't really enjoy it. It was just something I was decent at. Now, 10ish years later, I have found the saying "if you don't use it, you lose it" to be true. Turns out, writing is a very important skill that I brushed aside nearly a decade ago. I would like to get back to the point where I can organize my thoughts into an actual structure that flows from one point to another. Whether it be professionally or just socially being able to effectively communicate and convey my thoughts, opinions, and suggestions, makes all the difference.

<div>So, yeah... I want to work on that.</div>

The second goal of this blog is simple, create an area where I can talk about whatever's on my mind whether it be about whatever I'm learning at the moment, code, design, coffee, a personal project I'm working on, keeping myself accountable for the goals I set for myself, or anything really.

Well, that's really all I have for this one and if you've stuck with me this long, thanks for reading! I hope you'll come back and check out some of my other posts!
