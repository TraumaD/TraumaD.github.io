# Community Guidelines

#### Keep it civil aka don’t be a jerk
We’re going to get into the thick of a lot of heated discussions and that’s okay. These discussions often entail topics that we all personally care a lot about and will passionately defend. But in order for discussions to thrive here, we need to remember to criticize ideas, not people.

*So, remember to avoid:*
* name-calling
* ad hominem attacks
* Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
* knee-jerk contradiction

Comments that we find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing may be removed. If you don’t have something nice to say about another user, don't say it. Treat others the way you’d like to be treated.

Always strive to add value to every interaction and discussion you participate in
There are a lot of discussions that happen every day on Disqus. Before joining in a discussion, browse through some of the most recent and active discussions happening in the community, especially if you’re new there.If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.

#### Keep it tidy
Help make moderators’ lives easier by taking a moment to ensure that what you’re about to post is in the right place.

*That means:*
* don’t post off-topic comments or discussions
* don’t cross-post the same thing multiple times
* review any specific posting guidelines for the community
* check if another active discussion on your topic has already been posted


#### If you see something, say something
Moderators are at the forefront of combatting spam, mediating disputes and enforcing community guidelines and, so are you.
If you see an issue, contact the moderators if possible or flag any comments for review. If you believe someone has violated the Basic Rules, report it to Disqus by flagging the user's profile.

#### My House My Rules
I'm a pretty lax guy and If you stick to the "don't be a jerk" rule we probably won't have any problems.
That said this is my site and I can delete any comment / block any person for any reason I see fit without explanation or notice.
I may even remove the ability to commenting all together at any time without notice. I'm not entirely sure if I want comments and
this is more of an experiment.
