elementary OS is an open-source alternative to Windows or Mac OS. 
elementary is currently worked on by a team of mostly volunteers, of which I am one.
My main contributions lie in icon design, both for the official elementary icon sets
as well as third-party app developers. I have been part of the elementary team for several years
and continue to contribute as my free time allows. elementary is an ongoing project and continues to 
grown in both scope and needs.
