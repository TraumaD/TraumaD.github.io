Noah, a newly graduated 3D animator needed a professional branding
package to make himself stand out to potential clients and agencies.
Noah knew that he wanted his brand to be modern and clean, so working
with that parameter, we designed a package that included a personal
logo, business card, brand colors, and typography. His logo included a
stylized version of his initials, “NI”, and hints at a 3D space while only
being 2D, as 2D is more versatile, but gives him a better visual identity
that is representative of his skill set and projected career.

Noah also needed a professional website to display his online portfolio.
Noah wanted a website that could display his 3D models, youtube
tutorials, and featured projects. With these needs at the forefront, we
were able to create a responsive website that is modern, cleanly
organized, and can be easily updated to display all of his current works
and contact information.
