Noah, a newly graduated 3D animator needed a professional branding
package to make himself stand out to potential clients and agencies.
Noah knew that he wanted his brand to be modern and clean, so working
with that parameter, we designed a package that included a personal
logo, business card, brand colors, and typography. His logo included a
stylized version of his initials, “NI”, and hints at a 3D space while only
being 2D, as 2D is more versatile, but gives him a better visual identity
that is representative of his skill set and projected career.
